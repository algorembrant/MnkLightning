# How to use?

1. Open [Monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/).<br>
2. Go to the **Console** tab. (ctrl+shift+j for windows)<br>
3. Copy and paste the code from the `script_candidate.js` file into the console.<br>
4. Press Enter to run the code.<br>
5. The cheat should now be active and will begin typing automatically when you start typing.<br>
